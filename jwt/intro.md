# SPIRE authentication using JWT

This demonstration shows SPIRE inside Docker compose generating and validating
a JWT.

[TODO: Add additional flavor about this demo, the reasons for this use-case,
etc.]

[TODO: Add links to other relevant documentation]

[TODO: Add a diagram]

[TODO: Improve how JWTs are generated and validated, parsing out of
spire-agent could be improved]
