# Launch Kubernetes

**Wait for Kubernetes to start.**

The launch script starts Kubernetes and performs a few tasks to prepare the
environment:

+ Start kubernetes.
+ Wait for kubernetes to be fully available.
+ Copy the kubelet public key for SAT attestation verification.
+ Additional Katacoda-specific configuration.

# Once the prompt returns, continue

**IMPORTANT: Wait for the `DONE! Ready for the next step` message before
continuing. This will take a couple of minutes.**
